# Object Oriented Programming
Object Oriented Programming Projects (Fall 2018)

## Projects: 
* [Writing and Testing Sorting Algorithms](https://github.com/noahwill/csci245_OOP/tree/master/project1_SortingAlgs) - Am I Team QuickSort or Team MergeSort? Can I write an *O(n)* QuickSort algorithm? Can I learn C in a week so I can finish this project? All this... and more!

* [My First Calculator](https://github.com/noahwill/csci245_OOP/tree/master/project2_4FuncCalc) - Against the pressure of a 4 day deadline, I manage to squeeze out a *passable* object oriented project. This is probably the project I will think about when I run into walls on any future projects: if I could do it here when I knew nothing about Java, I can do it when I know a little more. 

* [Home Made Linked List](https://github.com/noahwill.csci245_OOP/tree/master/project3_LinkedList) - At this point in the semester, I had overcome the steep learning curve I faced of having to learn two new languages. The goal of this project was simple: to practice implementing a link-based structure and illustrate the workings of a map (as an example of an abstract data type)!

* [SUPERORGANISM](https://github.com/noahwill/csci245_OOP/tree/master/project4_SUPERORGANISM) - An adventure game! Working with one other student, I practiced responsible object oriented design and an agile development workflow. If you want to play, there is a .jar file in the folder! Can you become the SUPERORGANISM?

* [Bit Vectors in C](https://github.com/noahwill/csci245_OOP/tree/master/project5_BitVector) - After such the wonderful Java project above, it was time to dive to the lowest levels of C. Using pointers and dynamic allocation, I wrote functions to perform the basic set operations union, intersection, complement, and difference. I was also required to write an implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes!
