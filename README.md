## Object Oriented Design (Fall 2018)

* [Writing and Testing Sorting Algorithms](https://github.com/noahwill/csci245_OOP/tree/master/project1_SortingAlgs) - Am I Team QuickSort or Team MergeSort? Can I write an *O(n)* QuickSort algorithm? Can I learn C in a week so I can finish this project? All this... and more!

* [My First Calculator](https://github.com/noahwill/csci245_OOP/tree/master/project2_4FuncCalc) - Against the pressure of a 4 day deadline, I manage to squeeze out a *passable* object oriented project. This is probably the project I will think about when I run into walls on any future projects: if I could do it here when I knew nothing about Java, I can do it when I know a little more. 

* [Home Made Linked List](https://github.com/noahwill.csci245_OOP/tree/master/project3_LinkedList) - At this point in the semester, I had overcome the steep learning curve I faced of having to learn two new languages. The goal of this project was simple: to practice implementing a link-based structure and illustrate the workings of a map!

* [SUPERORGANISM](https://github.com/noahwill/csci245_OOP/tree/master/project4_SUPERORGANISM) - An adventure game! Working with one other student, I practiced responsible object oriented design and an agile development workflow. If you want to play, there is a .jar file in the folder! Can you become the SUPERORGANISM?

* [Bit Vectors in C](https://github.com/noahwill/csci245_OOP/tree/master/project5_BitVector) - After such the wonderful Java project above, it was time to dive back into C. Using pointers and dynamic allocation, I wrote functions to perform the basic set operations union, intersection, complement, and difference. I was also required to write an implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes.

* [Reverse Polish Notation](https://github.com/noahwill/csci245_OOP/tree/master/project6_RPNCalc) - To practice implementing a stack, this project was to take the set up from the first calculator and make one in reverse polish notation. "Make it Matter, Keep Reinventing"

* [NO IFS CALCULATOR](https://github.com/noahwill/csci245_OOP/tree/master/project7_NoIfCalc) - As the ultimate test of all the calculator knowledge from the semester and some principles of good design, I had to write a calculator without using any if statements. I practiced using the strategy, state, and singleton design patterns. At this point in the semester, a project like this took only a few hours of careful planning and diagramming, a few hours of hacking, and a few hours of testing and refactoring. I think comparing this calculator to my first shows just how far I've come in a few months of intense study.

* [Psuedo-Assembly](https://github.com/noahwill/csci245_OOP/tree/master/project8_PseudoAssembly) - Finally, diving back to some low level concepts, nine lines of code were given to the class to translate into a psuedo assembly language. This was to practice understanding how registers work to facilitate funcion calls and returns at the machine level.
