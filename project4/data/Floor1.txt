<<Rooms>>

-closet-
Closet
Just big enough for one, it smells like moth-balls and herring.

-ballroom-
Ballroom
The door is closed behind you, more doors to the east and west. Perhaps,
in another time, people who really appreciated aquatic life held grand
parties in this room. You can almost hear the scholars debating the origins
of the Balanaea mysticetus versus the Caperea marginata.

-creatureRoom1-
Creaky Room
The loose floor boards creak as you enter the room, causing a mass to stir
on the south side. Looking closer you see giant Sea Cucumber blocking a 
door to the south. It looks like its attacking, but slowly...

-deadend1-
Spooky Dead End
There are no doors besides the one you came through. There's a chill in the
air, it smells like destiny and storage in here.
