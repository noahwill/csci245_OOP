<<Rooms>>
-viewingroom-
Viewing Room
Looks out over the aquarium lawn. A dreary world where no one can swim.
Your mind wanders to your home where you dreamed of one day becoming a
creature that could swim...

-shrine-
Shrine Room
There is a shrine in the middle of the room. To the east there is a massive
hole in the floor keeping you from the door that way, but there is an open 
door to the west.

-creatureitem-
Neptune Room
The room is dimly lit, decorated in the mid-century style, and has a regal
and sea foam feel to it. In the back of the room, there is a ladder with 
some dark liquid on it... A massive creature leaps from the shadows! It 
looks like a sea turtle in  armour with a harpoon!! It is attacking, you 
need to react fast!

-squidroom-
Squid Room
You climb up the ladder. At the top you are greeted with the roar of a Kraken!
The beast moves its slimy tentacles to block the ladder. You'll have to defeat
it to be able to go back down. There doesn't seem to be any other exit.
