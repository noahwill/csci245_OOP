Drippy Pool
Who knows where all this water is coming from... Thankfully you found 
those flippers to swim with, otherwise you might have drowned. Just 
poking above the water level, there is a door frame to the north and 
one to the west. You should probably keep swimming if you want to go 
that way.

-pool2-
Deep Pool
This pool is much deeper than the last. There is something shining at the
bottom. Maybe you could dive for it? There is the door frame you just swam 
through to the south.

-pool3-
Infested Pool
Swimming in this pool sparks some kind of fight or flight feeling. You don't
feel safe swimming for the door frame to the south. Maybe you should go back 
or look around. 

-pool4-
Island Pool
There is a concrete island in the middle of this pool. A single beam of light
from a crack above shines on the island. here is the door frame you just swam 
through to the north.
